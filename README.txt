The vulnerable.module was originally written to accompany the book https://www.crackingdrupal.com It provides examples of insecure code that people can learn from:

* Learn to exploit the weaknesses
* Modify the code to remove the vulnerability

The code for this module is in 6.x-1.x and 7.x-1.x branches as is the standard on Drupal.org.

This module is for educational purposes only. "Fixes" welcome as pull requests on github.
